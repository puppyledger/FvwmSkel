# This list is used for generating the TryFont and SetFont menus. 
# Note that this is just a small sample derived from running xlsfonts. 
# You can adjust this list by running xlsfonts and copying the 
# fonts you like from that list into this file for system wide 
# access. Or you can create your own list by listing your 
# preferred fonts in:  $HOME/.xuserfonts/Urxvt.UserFont.txt
# which will be sorted into this list.
