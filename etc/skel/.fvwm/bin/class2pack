# Bash::Sugar is a collection of one (or a few) liners that makes 
# living with bash easier. If there is a "Can't locate Bash::Sugar" 
# error, then you need to adjust your PERL5LIB environment variable 
# to find the directory where Bash::Sugar lives. If you are using 
# FvwmSkel this is typically $HOME/.fvwm/lib/perl5

# This program just prints the help file for the Bash::Sugar programs. 
# Note that many programs symlink here, and that they will each run 
# their respectively named perl method in the Bash::Sugar class.
