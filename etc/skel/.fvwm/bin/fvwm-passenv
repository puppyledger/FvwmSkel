# Pass through script for FVWM environment variables. Since there is not 
# a good (or at least well documented)  way to reach into the FVWM 
# memory space, we use this to pass variables. We tell FVWM to run a 
# script, with the variable encapsulated. This command takes 1 
# argument which a command string with the environment variable 
# placed in the string as $<VAR> Example: fvwm-passenv 'xmessage $FOO bar'  
# will run xmessage with $FOO swapped out with FVWM's environment 
# variable FOO
