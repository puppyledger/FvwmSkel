#:
#:       Autolithic classes are self-registering classes, 
#: 		that only ever exist as a single instance. All calls 
#: 		to the constructor return the same object. This is
#:			intended for code frameworks.  
#: 
#:       so:   Foo.pm        API root class    
#:             Foo/Bar.pm    API object class
